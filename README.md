# AndroidTechnica
An Android application for Ars Technica readers, built on WebView and RSS. Originally, I realized that I was reading articles on Ars Technica a lot, but they didn't have an app. I thought that there was no better way to become more familiar with Android development then to make an app I would use a lot, so here it is.

## Features
* Access to all Ars Technica articles through their excellent mobile website
* Notifications of articles on a variable schedule
* Manage notifications or turn them off entirely
* Support for Notification Channels (Android 8 Oreo and above)
* Native dark theme
* Notifications on Wear OS with actions

## Known Issues
* After clicking on a notification, going back to the home page, and not using the app for a while, the app will reload the article that the notification was for, not the home page ([#1](https://github.com/awbooze/AndroidTechnica/issues/1))
* If articles are posted to two seperate RSS feeds, it results in duplicate notifications ([#2](https://github.com/awbooze/AndroidTechnica/issues/2))

## Feature Roadmap
* Allow users to search for text on the page ([#3](https://github.com/awbooze/AndroidTechnica/issues/3))
* Allow users to copy, share, and download images ([#4](https://github.com/awbooze/AndroidTechnica/issues/4))

And now, for the boring, but necessary parts.
